Changes implemented in the source code.

r6462mod5:
- modified modulator: improved level fading at end of the message transmission.
- 'RRR' message is replaced with 'RR73' message. 'Log QSO' prompt can be triggered
  by transmission any of these messages: 'RRR', 'RR73', '73'  
- three-pass decoding is implemented, decoder thresholds optimized for each pass.
  Advanced settings tab now provides possibility to choose between two- and three-pass decoding.
- changes of the FFT window functions, optimized for number of correct decodes criteria.
- implemented spectrum distortion functions for each decoding pass, optimized these functions 
  basing on the maximum number of correct decodes
- implemented functionality of high sensitivity, control button Preamp in main UI window, and
  possibility to choose number of passes in the Advanced settings tab. 'Random erasure patterns'
  is set to 8 for Preamp mode, it is not affected by settings in the Advanced tab now.
  Decoder thresholds and spectrum distortion functions were optimized for each Preamp pass.
  Signal subtraction is used between Preamp decoding passes.
- removed 'Robust sync' manual activation from Advanced settings tab.
- improved user interface in the main window.
__________________________________

r6462mod6:
- improved accuracy in signal subtraction (eliminated error in number of the samples). Small
  changes to the user interface main window.
__________________________________

r6462mod7:
- user interface improved, splitter inserted between left and right parts of the main window 
- users now have choice between RRR and RR73 message
- nbirdie(extract.f90) value optimization brougth some more new correct decodes. nbirdie=7 being
  used for Preamp OFF mode, nbirdie=6 for Preamp ON mode
- number of decoding attempts for Preamp OFF mode is set to 100
- number of decoding attempts for Preamp ON mode now can be choosen from this range: 1000,2500,
  5000,7500,10000 via Advanced settings tab by values 1,2,3,4,5
__________________________________

r6462mod8:
- number of decoding attempts for Preamp OFF mode increased from 100 to 300
- implemented 'Filter' button/functionality: eliminating vast majority of the false decodes
- improved JT65 decoding efficiency for DT range [-1..0], this functionality is implemented
  only in the Filter ON mode by 26000 sample offset of the input data
- for all Preamp/Filter combinations increased JT65 DT decoding range
- for all Preamp/Filter combinations implemented some additional filtering of the false decodes
- standard CQ message is generated on WSJT-X start up, it should eliminate some cases of the empty 
  message transmission
- input data is reloaded if 'Filter' button is triggered, so it is possible to decode again latest
  RX interval data in any combination of the Filter/Preamp modes using button 'Decode'
__________________________________

r6462mod9:
- implemented dual SYNC search functionality with 1/4 symbol spectrum shift, getting more 
  correct JT65 decodes.
__________________________________

  For subpass 1.1 maximum number of candidates is limited to 21, for subpass 1.2 to 25.
  Decoded signals being marked in the SYNC list and ignored while doing subpass 1.2.  
  In fact in mod11 revision we have got very effective four-pass JT65a decoding.
- SWL ON functionality is changed: now it is based on the SWL OFF functionality, simple 3 unit 
  offset is applied to the decoding attempts value settings for SWL ON mode. SWL ON and SWL ON decoding
  attempts approximately balanced for corresponding decoding time.   
__________________________________

r6462mod12 JT65a optimization, focused on weak signals reception:

  candidate was decoded and signal subtracted. This fix shall make decoding a bit faster.
- turned on signal subtraction on the 3rd decoding pass, reduced number of the false FTRSD decodes
- fchisq65 and afc65b source code is modified, now providing better DT calculation accuracy and reduced number
  of the false FTRSD decodes

  file data is used for this functionality and this filtering is not activated if number 
  of records in CALL3.TXT file is less than 16000. CALL3.TXT data loaded in memory 
  at the first attempt to check decoded message.
- modified JT65 signal simulator with CQ DX message
- minor change in UI, tab name Help -> About JTDX
__________________________________

JTDX v15.9  JT65 functionality

  this approach lets to decrease number of candidates hence decreasing decoding time
- fifth decoding pass is implemented. This functionality will gain number of the decoded messages
  if number of signals on the band is greater than 20. There is also gain in weak signal FTRSD
  and hinted decodings.
__________________________________

JTDX v16.0  JT65 functionality
- filtering of the false FTRSD decoded messages expanded down to the 14-character message length
- additional criterion(0.005sec DT offset) implemented to filter out FTSRD false decodes with grid 
  locators caused by the SYNC signal harmonics (bad TX signal or IMD in the RX path), the same 
  chkfalse.f90 source code is used for filtering, also based on the CALL3.TXT file
- checking for SYNC harmonics implemented, based on three criteria: DT offset, ccfbest value, 
  frequency greater than 1500Hz. Wideband hinted decoders bypass is used if signal meeting these
  criteria.
- mouse left button double click on the waterfall now triggering 'Filter' functionality where messages
  will be decoded and signals subtracted in 400Hz bandwidth, but only messages in 50Hz bandwidth 
  will be shown in the decoded messages window. This is a bit different from the 'Filter' button 
  functionality where messages shown in the decoded window within 100Hz bandwidth
- found and fixed defect: wrong signals were subtracted for hinted decodes
- cleaned up some rubbish and some not used code, many integer variables changed to the logical type.

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.0.1

- software installation is changed, logbook and settings file are stored in folder %LOCALAPPDATA%\JTDX,
  settings file has name JTDX.INI now. Prefix in the interface name for UDP connection is changed from
  WSJT-X to JTDX.

- implemented mutiple instances support for JTDX <-> JTAlert interaction, where multiple JTDX instances running
  using key '--rig-name=' (suffix of the interface name for UDP connection). This functionality is supported
  in JTAlert 2.8.5. Every JTDX instance shall be configured with unique UDP port number in the Settings-Reporting
  tab.

- defect fixed: starting from JTDX v16.9 there was excessive decoding time if there were few signals
  on the band. This defect also caused too high sensitivity of the Hint decoders and some false hinted decodes.

- WSJT-X patches r7229, r7233 are applied: TX audio level settings saving per band

- TX audio level settings saving feature is expanded to the 'per band and per mode' basis,
  many thanks to Arvo ES1JA for provided source code and testing this functionality  

- minor change in the functionality is done: TX mode is set to JT65 instead of JT9 if user changing
  mode from WSPR to JT65+JT9

- minor change in configuration is done: hyphen sign is allowed now in 'My Call' window, letting to 
  use complex SWL callsigns for band monitoring with spots reporting. Many thanks to Oleg US-E-12 for
  provided solution.

- software crash is fixed, caused by getting index of the dtchk() data structure out of the top bound.
  Message 'input audio signal is distorted' being generated now and decoding this minute interval being
  interrupted, while software will handle this issue and will continue to work.

- Hint decoders bypass is implemented for scenario where signal SNR is greater than -05. This solution
  will allow to decrease number of the false hinted decodes for distorted audio signal with no affect 
  on the sensitivity.
__________________________________

 JTDX v17.1

- decoding passes logic is changed in jt65_decode.f90, in result there is increased number of the weak 
  signals decoded by FTRSD

- defect is fixed, if callsign is clicked in JTAlert initial CQ message is now propagated into RX frequency
  window. Many thanks to Arvo ES1JA for this patch. Thanks to Ed K0KC for reporting of this bug.

- changed functionality for accepting decoded message from two Hint decoders operating on the RX frequency:
  decoded Hint message is banned as the false one if there was message decoded by BM/FTRSD on one 
  of the previous decoding passes that contains the same callsigns. It should reduce a bit number of the false 
  Hint decodes. Thanks to Luc VE2FXL for reporting of this scenario.

- new functionality is implemented for one of the four Hint decoders which working on RX frequency with CALL3.TXT
  data: five minute (5 min 14 seconds) timer is (re-)started at end of the each transmission or if Hint button 
  is activated by user, it is used to automatically enable/disable propagation of the non-CQ decoded Hint messages 
  from this decoder. The messages will be shown on the screen if timer is running and are banned if timer is expired.
  Hence if user making QSO then all messages being accepted from this decoder, if user going to the passive mode of band 
  monitoring then in five consecutive RX intervals non-CQ messages from this decoder will be banned. Such approach 
  will let user to reduce number of the false Hint decodes being in the band monitoring mode.
  Thanks to Luc VE2FXL for reporting of this scenario.

- first step done towards assisted BM/FTRSD decoder functionality. Upon exceeding defined thresholds decoded messages 
  being checked with the matched filter against the received signal. If it is free message in it is not matched, then
  this message is banned. In case it is standard message and it is not matched, then it is checked against CALL3.TXT
  data if any of two callsigns exists in the CALL3.TXT. Standard message being treated as false one if both callsigns
  are not found in the CALL3.TXT file.
  This approach lets to ban from 30 to 50 percents of the false FTRSD decodes.

- expanded sound notifications for the 'non-worked B4' status functionality. Many thanks to Vytas LY3BG and 
  his son Rimas Kudelis for supplied source code and making tests of this functionality.

 JTDX v17.1.1  - is based on JTDX v17.1, has got alternative 'new one' notification functionality implemented 
 by Arvo ES1JA
__________________________________


 JTDX v17.2

- fixed wrong UTC indication if interval or audio wav file being decoded again by Decode button

- fixed wrong 'new one'(worked B4) functionality notification for single JT9 or JT65 mode of operation, many thanks to
  Vytas LY3BG and Rimas Kudelis for this patch

- auto stop Hint five minute timer is also applied to DX Call Hint decoder.
  Thanks to Luc VE2FXL for reporting of this scenario.

- directional CQ WSJT-X patches 'CQ AA'- 'CQ ZZ' (E9AA-E9ZZ) r7289, r7294 are applied. It is standard type message user
  may type now in the free message box

- '@ TNX 73' TX macro is set as default free message, where '@' symbol handles 'his call'

- RX frequency CALL3.TXT data based Hint decoder is split to the message specific decoders, memory usage for this
  group of the Hint decoders is reduced. There are three decoders now in this group:
  - 'CQ hiscall hisgrid' message decoder
  - 'mycall hiscall hisgrid' message decoder
  - 'mycall hiscall report' message decoder, where report is -01...-30 only. R-01...R-30 report messages 
     are not supported now in this group as these messages are covered by DX Call hint decoder

- new wideband experience based Hint decoder is implemented, bringing approximately 5% more decoded messages for number
  of decoding attempts set to 1 in the Advanced tab. This decoder using call/frequency data from the last two consecutive 
  RX intervals.

 JTDX v17.2.1  - is based on JTDX v17.2, has got alternative improved and expanded 'new one' 
 notification functionality, implemented by Arvo ES1JA. This version is especially created 
 for public testing and this 'new one' notification functionality might come in the main JTDX branch 
 if accepted by majority of users.
 
 It is recommended to use default colors until this functionality is understood by user, and to set only
 required criteria for checking.

 So far it is possible to reset color settings to the default values, only if JTDX.INI file is deleted.

- fixed bug (v17.1.1) where grid locator was not extracted correctly from
 the non-CQ standard messages.


- strikethrough or underline may now be used as notification for the Woked Call in CQ and MyCall messages.
  Underline is set by default.

- background color may now be used for the Worked Call notificaton, standalone or togehter with 
   
   strikethrough or underline of the decoded CQ  and MyCall messages.

- if 'Inverse text/background color' checkbox is checked:

   'CQ' and 'MyCall' messages met the 'New..' criterion will use their setting's text color as the backgound color,
    while 'new..' color will be used for text in these messages. If there 'New..' criterion is not met then 'Worked Call'
    color will be used for text in these messages if it is activated.

    Tx messages always have background color notification.

    All other standard messages will be using 'Standard Message' background color and 'New...' text color 
    notification if 'Check all standard messages' checkbox is checked, otherway there is no any checking performed
    for these messages.


- user now can choose 'Standard message' background color (in 17.1.1 it was hardcoded as gray one).
  Gray color us set by default.

 JTDX v17.2.2  - is based on JTDX v17.2.1, has got alternative improved and expanded 'new one' 
 notification functionality, implemented by Arvo ES1JA. This version is especially created 
 for public testing and this 'new one' notification functionality might come in the main JTDX branch 
 if accepted by majority of users.

 v17.2.2 fixes some bugs found in the version 17.2.1:

- Bold font usage failure

- '@ TNX 73' TX macro is set as default free message, where '@' symbol handles 'his call',
   user would have to delete old JTDX.INI file to make this change visible

- several bugs where 'New ..' status was incorrectly reported

Important note to the functionality description: 'Worked..' notification is a remaining action of the 'New..' checks,
and as per design it being applied to 'CQ' and 'MyCall' messages only.

 JTDX v17.3  - is based on v17.2 source code, JT65 functionality:

- DX Call based Hint decoder is split to the four focused decoders, bringing JT65 decoding sensitivity 
  down to -34dB SNR:
  - decoder for CQ/CQ DX messages
  - decoder for messages with '-' reports
  - decoder for messages with 'R-' reports
  - decoder for RRR/RR73/73 messages

- time transition from 23:5x to 00:0x is covered by uninterrupted interval numbering within 7 consecutive days 
  of running JTDX software, this lets to support experience(previous intervals) based Hint decoders funcionality 
  for the date change time window

- new wideband experience(previous intervals) based Hint decoder is implemented for the basic CQ and full range of 
  directional CQ messages (CQ AA to CQ ZZ)

- disabled RX frequency CALL3.TXT based Hint decoder, which processed report "-" messages. This functionality 
  is covered by DX Call based Hint decoder with better sensitivity and less resource being used.

- for DXCall based Hint decoders, excluding CQ/CQ DX decoder, data from previous decoded intervals being used now
  together with data from the DXCall window

- excluding CQ/CQ DX message, other DXCall Hint decoders using additional trigger for getting turned on: RX frequecy
  change

- adjusted thresholds for all 10 Hint decoders using ratio (maximum sensitivity)/(acceptable number of the false decodes) 
  as criterion   

- expanded filters for the false FTRSD decodes, being now used QTH grid square and callsign prefix data

- modified filter of the standard messages for the 'new one' notifications

- notification settings are put in the common tab with the color settings, 'Notifications' tab in the Configuration 
  user interface

- applied WSJT-X patch r7360, to recover CW ID transmission for long callsigns

- updated CALL3.TXT file as of December 12th 2016, 17340 records, supplied with the JTDX software package.

Now there are 10 Hint decoders in the JTDX v17.3 software, using matched filters in wide bandwidth or RX frequency,
focused on some range or specific messages, and using data from CALL3.TXT file or from previously decoded 
intervals or from DXCall/DXGrid windows. All these decoders are activated by the Hint button, but some of them
being turned off using timer and being brought back in service by transmission of the message of by change of the RX
frequency.

There is unchangeable DT window set in the code for some Hint decoders, previous intervals data based Hint decoders 
using +-0.2sec DT window to the last decodes to process candidate, and only for two Hint decoders working on 
the RX frequency and based on the CALL3.TXT data user may change DT range in the General->Advanced tab settings.

JTDX software is made in such way that vast majority of the Hint decoders functionaly goes invisibly to user, and
from user's point of view all Hint decoders being controlled by the Hint button.

 JTDX v17.3.1  - is based on v17.3 source code, notification functionality is based on the v17.2.2 source
 code and implemented by Arvo ES1JA

- displaying country name/prefix is aligned

- notification filters are implemented and improved for all possible standard messages

- now it is possible to apply striked/underlined 'worked B4' notifications to the standard messages other
  than containing 'CQ' or 'MyCall'. This functionality may be switched on/off by user.

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.3.2  - is based on v17.3.1 source code, vast majority of the changes made by Arvo ES1JA

- fixed bug of new DXCC notification if there is no user callsign set in the settings

- fixed defect that allowed to check in 'Show prefix not name' box if 'Show DXCC names' is not checked

- more filters added to prevent 'New one ' criteria being triggered by the free text messages

- deleted checkboxes for setting striked/underlined 'Worked B4' notifications for other than CQ/MyCall
  standard messages

- changed color notifications for other than CQ/MyCall standard messages from background color to the text
  color. Now all checks setting the same attribute: either background color or text color.

- some changes for 'Bold' font attribute usage: now all 'New ' criteria checks setting 'Bold' attribute for 
  decoded text message, if any criterion is met

- added QSO counter in the status bar, at right bottom corner of the user interface. wsjtx_log.adi being 
  used to count JT65/JT9 contacts.

- added date for every decoded message in the ALL.TXT file. It shall simplify searching for any QSO missed
  in the logbook.

  It is not recommended to set 'Bold' attribute in the decoded text font settings(Settings->General tab),
  as 'Bold' attribute being used in the 'New one ' notification functionality.

 JTDX v17.4  is based on the v17.3.2 source code

- all FTRSD false decode filters reworked and moved as block close to the FTRSD decoder, allowing to attempt
  decode candidate with Hint decoders if decoded message is considered as the false one

- implemented AGC compensation functionality, where noise level change triggered by AGC operation in the receiver
  being compensated in JTDX software, bringing improved decoding efficiency while AGC is in operation.
  AGCc button is implemented in main user interface to turn ON/OFF this functionality. 
  This button shall be turned off by user if JT signals are not strong enough to trigger AGC or if 
  AGC is turned OFF in the receiver.

- most of the checkings for the false FTRSD decode now based on information from the ALLCALL.TXT file.
  This file is installed into /bin/data/ path by the JTDX v17.4 installer and has a list of callsigns spotted
  in JT modes for last couple years. CALL3.TXT file being now mostly used for Hint decoders operation and 
  containig data from JT spots of the last months.

- 'New one' notification functionality is modified: added preview pane in the Notifications tab of the settings.
   It has simplified notification color settings. This functionality is designed and implemented 
   by Arvo ES1JA.

- decoded message windows now have table format. Special cell with red color background being used now
  for additional notification for decoded messages containing MyCall. It makes easier to recognise decoded
  messages if somebody responding to user outside of the RX frequency.  

- now user can send QSO data to the eQSL server. Configuration settings are added to the Reporting tab.
  This functionality is implemented by Arvo ES1JA and may be switched ON/OFF by user.

- introduced independent notification funcationality per band and per mode. This functionality is 
  designed and implemented by Arvo ES1JA.

- implemented selective DXCall Hint decoders activation based on the last transmitted message.
  This feature has reduced number of the false Hint decodes on RX frequency during the QSO.

- applied +-0.2 second DT window to most of the DXCall Hint decoders, centered to DT value of the last decoded
  signal. This functionality has reduced number of the false Hint decodes on RX frequency during the QSO.

- CQ/CQ DX DXCall Hint decoder is splitted to two decoders: one is for CQ, other is for CQ DX message.
  Temporarily suppressed sensitivity of the CQ DX message DXCall Hint decoder, planning to finish this
  functionality in the next JTDX version.

- new DXCall Hint decoder is introduced for 'MyCall + HisCall + GRID' message, just in case of retransmission 
  of this message during the QSO. Now JTDX v17.4 has got twelve Hint decoders.

- now SRAND random number generator is used in FTRSD decoder for any signal candidate coming with SNR 
  less than -24dB. Combined with several decoding passes, SRAND usage has increased decoding efficiency 
  of the weak signals.

- expanded DECODE button usage to decode again the JT9 signals, that might be used while switching ON/OFF AGCc
  button.
__________________________________

 JTDX v17.5  is based on the v17.4 source code

- memory allocation is reworked for the large arrays of JT65 and JT9 signals

- defects fixed: ALLCALL.TXT file allocation for MAc OS-X and Linux builds, several bugs in the 'notifications'
  functionality, wrong GRID square indication in DX Grid window if any other callsign's report/RRR/73 message 
  is clicked, wrong country name displaying for free text messages containing TU73, in notification about loss
  of connection to the eQSL server, wrong interval time displaying if JT9 messages decoded again using Decode
  button, added extra notification about copying CALL3.TXT file to the log directory, bug of displaying messages
  with internally used 'CF00' Grid square in the wideband experience based Hint decoder, callsign truncation to
  5 characters at displaying of the decoded WSPR messages, withdrawn 13-character limitation in Configuration
  line edit for macros entry, truncation of text on labels in the main interface status bar, alignment of messages 
  color background in the RX frequency window

- modified main window UI1 and Configuration UI, added link to JTDX Web page in the Help

- configurable automatic clearance of DXCall DXGrid upon exit from JTDX is added for UR5EQF logbook software users

- added beep notification on the first decoded message in the RX interval

- added combobox color notification if text message length in the Free text message combobox is exceeded 13 (for 
  free message) and 17 (for directional CQ message with 6-character callsign) characters

- added background color notification about current minute and TX ODD/EVEN checkbox settings

- reworked wideband previous intevals data based Hint decoder, it is made as selective one to the expected message
  and internally splitted to 6 focused decoders. In result is reduced number of the false Hint decodes.
  Total number of Hint decoder subroutines in v17.5 is 11, total number of the Hint decoders now is 16.  

- reworked DXCall/DXGrid based Hint decoder of the CQ messages, now any directional CQ message being supported 
  in this decoder

- FTRSD and wideband CQ/CQ DX messages Hint decoders bypass is applied, if SNR of the candidate signal is less
  than -30.0dB SNR. A bit decreased time of decoding and number of the false Hint decodes. 

- For BM/FTRSD decoder is added three more decoding passes focused on the QSO RX frequency (bandwidth is +-3Hz),
  time to frequency domain conversion and candidate list renew being used for each of these decoding passes, up
  to two candidates in the list per each decoding pass.
  This functionality is applied after the first wideband decoding pass and may not be turned OFF, only BM/FTRSD
  decoder being involved in this functionality, decoding efficiency is optimized. 
  User can set number of RX frequency decoding attempts for the new RX frequency decoding passes in the Advanced
  tab. There is solid increase in FTRSD decoding efficiency of the weak signals on the RX frequency for minimum 
  number of the decoding attempts set in Advanced tab.
  With this functionality JTDX may decode up to 7 signals on the QSO RX frequency.

- changed bandwidth for noise part of SNR calculation from approximately 560 to 180Hz, SNR is recalibrated using
  simulated signals from .wav files

- <eQSL_QSL_SENT:1>Y being added to the wsjtx_log.adi file if QSO data is sent to eQSL server, waiting for response
  from the eQSL server is increased to 10 seconds

 JTDX v17.5.1 is based on the v17.5 source code

- recovered AGCc functionality that is broken in v17.5

- added notification for possibly false FTRSD decoded standard messages: questionmark with yellow background, right
  after the message. Such messages being blocked for sending to the pskreporter.info server.

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.5.2 is based on the v17.5.1 source code

- some WSJT-X patches are applied: 6581,6588,6589,6590,6597,6599,6618,6622,6636,6650,6651,6658,6659,6660,6661,6703,
  6705,6750,6755,6766,7030,7031,7032,7038,7039,7122,7124,7130,7293,7320,7390,7357,7457

- skipped audio .wav files recording to HDD if user selected 'Save -> None'

- reworked anti-aliasing filter for 48000 -> 12000 Hz sampling rate conversion of the RX signal

- decoded standard messages for worked DXCC/Grid square/Callsign may now be skipped in the decoded messages window 
  using new control checkbox 'Don't show it' in the Notifications tab. This functionality may be applied to CQ messages
  by default and to other standard messages if 'Check other standard messages' checkbox is checked there.

- updated Hamlib to the latest version

- several changes done to prevent dupe Hint decodes appear in the decoded message window

- software development kit is changed from Qt 5.2 to Qt 5.5. There now more fonts available in the JTDX drop down menu, 
  also decreased size of the JTDX installation package. Those users who building JTDX themselves under MS Windows shall 
  now switch Qt environment using commands 'enable-qt55' and 'build-hamlib3'.

- KG4W callsign is added to cty.dat file VA, USA

- added combobox color notification if text message length in the tx5 message combobox, tab 1 of QSO messages, is 
  exceeded 13 (for free message) and 17 (for directional CQ message with 6-character callsign) characters

- fixed bug in Filter functionality: in previous versions left mouse button double click on the waterfall caused whole
  JT65 frequency range decoding instead of the 400 Hz.

- several criteria are applied to prevent false CQ Hint decodes in presence of the strong JT65 signal on the band

__________________________________
 
 JTDX v17.5.2-SWL  is based on the v17.5.2 source code

- expanded JT65 SNR reporting range from -35 to +35dB, SNR levels calibrated up to +35dB using simulated
  .wav audio files

- banned transmission of the messages, as JT65-HF software does not support reception of messages
  with reports in the extended range

 JTDX v17.6  is based on the v17.5.2 source code

ATTENTION: built v17.6 package has shifted dynamic range towards weak signals and superior performance in weak
signal decoding by FTRSD at poor propagation conditions if there are less than 12 signals on the band.
Top part of dynamic range will be addressed in v17.6.1 where the same source code will be used, difference only 
in the specific build. So far we do not know why dynamic range being shifted at specific build. 

- fixed bug of color inversion in the notification functionality, occured if there is not any checking 
  criterion chose.

- fixed bug where TX mode was changed if there other mode signal is decoded on the RX frequency

- fully dynamic decoding attempts recalculation based on the remaining number of candidates per each wideband 
  decoding pass. It has brought some more efficiency for weak signals decoding by FTRSD if there are few signals 
  on the band.

- 'hide messages from continents' functionality: it is some kind of the virtual DX window where local signals may
  being not shown. Effectevily reducing information overloading to user.

- 'beep on the wanted callsign' functionality: it will let user to avoid continious visual screen monitoring, 
  replacing it with the sound notification. System sound being used from default playback device set in 
  the operating system. At the moment callsign lenght is limited to 6 characters. Rest of any decoded message 
  shown on the screen being checked for the wanted callsign. 

- some improvement of the AGC compensation functionality for JT65 signal decoding

- changes in the mainwindow interface: TX odd/even checkbox is replaced with the button, more suitable allocation 
  is chose for it.

- now JTDX does support up to 200 JT65 decoded messages

- two frequency mask decoding passes added. Frequency mask being derived from the first decoding pass.
  Frequency mask decoding is enabled in the code by default, depending on number of the signals on the band 
  software making decision to turn it OFF (software does recognize band conditions and frequency mask decoding 
  can be automatically turned off if there are too many signals on the band). New setting in the Advanced tab 
  does prohibit turning frequency mask decoding passes OFF, it makes some benefit for overloaded band scenario 
  and shall be used if user has fast CPU.

- 'bad data' diagnostic print is replaced with 'audio gap detected'. In such scenario some sample being filled with
  1.0 value and software attempting to decode this RX interval. It was not allowed in the previous JTDX versions. 

- reduced number of calculations and expanded time range for weak level of the input signal detection.
  Diagnostic print 'low rms' is replaced with the 'input signal low rms', as in the previous JTDX versions such RX
  interval being not passed to the decoders.

- increased number of processed records: up to 40k in file ALLCALL.TXT and up to 35k in file CALL3.TXT

- updated in software file ALLCALL.TXT. There is new CALL3.TXT being supplied along with the software package, this
  new file is not compatible with JTDX software versions earlier than v17.6.

- changed type of data in the large Hint arrays from 4 bytes to the 1 byte. It has allowed to decrease allocated 
  memory volume caused by the CALL3 file extension.

- audio buffer size is changed in software: for input signal from 100ms to 2 seconds, for output signals from 1 to 
  2 seconds

- top frequency border for JT65 signal decoding is increased from 2700Hz to 3000Hz

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.6.1  is based on the v17.6 source code

v17.6.1 has effective JT65 signals decoding in overcrowded band conditions. v17.6 has better sensitivity for weak 
signal decoding in low populated band conditions versus v17.6.1. There are two possible reasons to make upgrade 
from v17.6 to v17.6.1: if user has slow CPU and can not use frequency mask decoding, or user need to fix bugs 
described below. Also both version can be used on the same computer if installed in the different folders. 

- fixed bug in inverse color notifications for other standard messages

- fixed bug in distance calculation for grid QTH square on the same longtitude: applied WSJT-X patch r7045.

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.7  is based on the v17.6.1 source code

- there is a gap at 1-st second of input data under Windows XP, source code is changed to fill in
  this gap and to prevent 'audio gap detected' diagnostic message to appear on the screen in this
  scenario

- now JTDX works with no CALL3.TXT file,  while there some functionality will be missed
  in Hint decoders and recognition of the false FTRSD decodes if CALL3 file is missed. There are
  up to 4 reminders to copy CALL3.TXT file to the log directory after each start of the JTDX
  software, each reminder being triggered by various parts of the source code.   

- changed program's icon and installation logo

- added waterfall graphics for Filter button

- increased allowed length from 'beep on wanted callsign' to 11 characters

- added validators for DX Call, DX Grid and wanted callsign windows line edit

- changes for the signal meter: range expanded to 90dB, measuring peak values 
  rather than rms, color being changed for too weak or too strong signal.
  Signal meter indication now allowing user to match input signal dynamic range 
  with ADC dynamic range and JTDX dynamic range, also can be used to evaluate noise level 
  of the sound card's input.

- RX gain slider deleted from main user interface.

- new 'Filter' tab in configuration user interface

- added 'hide free messages' filter option for non RX frequency 

- reduced minimal size and changed proportions for large size of the main user interface

- redistributed number of decoding attempts for Advanced tab settings 'Number of decoding attempts' =1 or =2, 
  users with these settings will get more weak signals decoded in comparison to v17.6

- fixed bugs: wrong UTC at decoding again in JT9 mode (Decode button usage),
  prolonged decoding at decoding again in JT9 mode (Decode button usage)

- increased decoding efficiency of JT9 Fano decoder at RX frequency: more decoding attempts being used

- decoding JT9 again: for TX mode = JT9 pushing Decode button triggering attempt to decode JT9 signal 
  on RX frequency again with more decoding attempts being used, bringing the best decoding efficiency. 
  Decoding bandwith is +-2 Hz relatively to the RX frequency, number of candidates is limited to 2.

- changed 'decode again' logic: if TX mode is set to JT9 then JT65 decoder will be bypassed, 
  if TX mode is set to JT65 then JT9 decoder will be bypassed

- enabled decoding at rest of RX interval: decoding after late start of JTDX, decoding 
  after the halted TX in the same minute interval. Threshold is set to 35th second of the minute 
  interval and it is still possible to decode -01dB SNR JT65 signals from remaining 12 seconds 
  of message transmission. Band change: if it is changed after 12th and prior 35th second of 
  an RX interval then signals from both bands will be decoded, if it is changed after 35th second 
  of an RX interval then signals from previous band will be decoded.

- added new 20m subband in selection for shared JT65/JT9 operation from 14080 to 14085 KHz.

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.8  is based on the v17.7 source code

- fixed bug: dupe JT9 message shall not be passed to the decoded text window if delta frequency between 
  these signals is less than 17 Hz

- JT9 decode again functionality with mouse's left button double click now triggering decoding of
  JT9 signals in frequency span +- 20Hz from frequency selected on the waterfall

- implemented message text filters that will allow to show only 'CQ' or 'CQ, RRR, RR73, 73' messages
  in the decoded text window. New filters do not process messages with 'MyCall'.  New text filters can
  be activated in the 'Filters' tab of settings

- ALLCALL.TXT file is updated, CALL3.TXT file as of 31.03.2017 is supplied together with the software package

- implemented band scheduler functionality, now user can schedule band switching in transceiver. 
  Antenna switching is not supported in JTDX, band scheduler will not change band if 'Enable TX' button
  is active. Up to five band can be scheduled, functionality can be activated in the 'Scheduler' tab of
  settings.

- possibly false JT65 FTRSD decoded messages now can be forbidden for transmission via UDP to external
  software, for instance to JTAlert, reducing number of the false sound notifications and number of the
  false spots being sent to the hamspots.net server. This functionality is turned on by default and 
  can be deactivated by user in 'Reporting' tab of the settings.

- ramp is implemented in modulator for first tone of transmission, it should reduce interference 
  at beginning of the minute interval
  
- JT10 mode is implemented with sensitivity threshold close to -28dB SNR. Coding is taken from JT9 mode,
  modulation is modified: two lower tones are used for SYNC vector, 8 upper tones are used for message data, 
  frequency bin (tone) width is around 1.7 Hz, minimal distance between two neighbouring tones 
  is around 6.9 Hz, occupied bandwidth is around 65 Hz, message transmission takes close to 49 seconds.
  'Filter' button limits decoding bandwidth to 160 Hz, software will try to decode any JT10 signal with SYNC 
   vector located inside this bandwidth.
  JT10 mode being considered as alternative to JT65A, with benefits of sensitivity, spectra density and 
  resistance to the Doppler frequency spreading.  
  Signal subtraction and Hint decoding is not yet supported for JT10 mode.

- 14080..14085 KHz subband, assigned in v17.7 for shared JT65/JT9 operation, now is reallocated to JT10.

   There are two timers implemented to limit JT10 decoding time: 12 seconds for on air operation and 30
seconds for SWL mode. JT10 candidate list being ranked by SYNC power, strongest signals will be decoded
first, there are up to 200 candidates allowed in the list. Remaining in the list candidates will be 
dropped if decoding timer is expired.

Decoding again functionality of JT9/JT10 signals is different from JT65A one: +-3 Hz frequency
span being used if 'Decode' button is pressed, +- 20 Hz frequency span being used if user double clicking 
by mouse's left button on the waterfall. Software using this span to look for the SYNC pattern. 

__________________________________

 JTDX v17.9  is based on the v17.8 source code

- JT10 mode is renamed to T10 (stands for 'tonal 10')

- fixed bug: there were dupe decoded messages of the strong T10 signals. Now 45 Hz distance is 
  being used to ban dupe T10 decoded messages

- two pass decoding with signal subtraction is implemented to T10 and JT9 modes

- fixed bug in T10 and JT9 message generators, 69th(last) data tone there was corrupted

- five QSO RX grequency Hint decoders implemented to T10 and JT9 modes:
  DXCall based decoders for messages: 'MyCall HisCall Grid', report, R+report and RRR/RR73/73
  CALL3 based decoder for message: 'MyCall HisCall Grid'.
  DT range from -0.5 to +1.5 second and frequency span +-2 Hz is applied to all QSO RX frequency T10/JT9
  Hint decoders

- T10 decoding passes timer is changed to 5+5 seconds

- TCP client is implemented to pass QSO data in single ADIF string to the external logbook software. 
  Connection to DXKeeper, N1MM and Logger32 logbook software is being supported. 
  TCP client can be configured and activated in Reporting tab of the settings. 

- user defined frequency ceiling is added to JT65 decoder and Advanced tab of the settings is updated 
  with the new parameter, by default it is set to 3000 Hz

- Hamlib version is updated (as of June 3rd, 2017)

- fixed bug: signal report was extracted from last of the several decoded messages having 'MyCall' 
  in the current time interval, now message with HisCall (DxCall) being used for signal report extraction

- added new functionality: left mouse button double click on any 'MyCall HisCall (R)report' decoded message 
  triggering extraction of the signal report

- 30MHz limit is withdrawn for recording frequency changes into ALL.TXT file if 'TX frequency 
  changes is not allowed while transmitting' in general tab of the settings

- ALLCALL.TXT file is updated, version as of June 12th, 2017

- fixed bugs where change of band or mode in the current RX interval triggered early additional decoding 
  and
  Halt TX then TX message change and continue TX, triggered early decoding in the next interval

- wsjtx_log.adi file processing is changed to accept multistring structure for single QSO record.
  Now ADIF export from DX4WIN logbook can be added into wsjtx_log.adi file

 JTDX v18.0  is based on the v17.9 source code

- JT9 signal decoding efficiency is improved in JT9 mode and combined JT9+JT65 mode.
  Single JT9 mode of operation has the best JT9 signal decoding efficiency.

- bandpass Filter and SWL functionality is implemented to the standalone JT9 mode. 
  Filter has 100 Hz bandwidth and is dedicated for usage with slow CPUs.

- Bins/Pixel and NAvg waterfall UI settings now do not affect gain of signal on the waterfall

- if 'Lock TX=RX' is unchecked, mouse's right button click will set TX frequency while RX frequency 
  will not be changed. Now there are three options to control frequency by mouse on the waterfall 
  when 'Lock TX=RX' checkbox is unchecked:
	- click of left mouse button will set RX frequency
	- CTRL button + mouse left button click will set TX and RX frequencies
	- click of right mouse button will set TX frequency

- minor bug fixed in JT9/T10 Hint decoders where there was possible to decode 'mycall 73' 
  message if DxCall window was cleared

- AGCc functionality is reworked. Now there is a little infulence of AGC compensation functionality 
  on the decoding efficiency if AGC is not triggered in the receiver.

- waterfall signal scaling implemented, it eliminates AGC noise step on the waterfall

- srand number generator in FTRSD decoder is replaced with rand number generator where seed 
  number is unique per each decoding pass. Now decoding again of the same wav file or interval 
  shall give more or less equal results.

- decoding of 2nd and 3rd JT65A harmonics is implemented with optional diagnostic 
  print of the decoded message. Depth of harmonics decoding can be set in Advanced tab of the Settings 
  where depth = 0 means there is no decoding of the harmonics, diagnostic print can be turned on/off 
  in Misc tab of the main UI window.

- hide main window menus and hide waterfall controls functionality is implemented basing on the WSJT-X code.
  Main window UI got 'Menus' checkbox, widegraph UI got 'Controls' checkbox.

- subtraction of decoded JT65 signals-harmonics is implemented, this functionality can improve JT65 signal
  decoding efficiency. 

- user defined timer is implemented to eQSL sending, it can be set in Reporting tab of the settings

- implemented bypass of all message filters, it can be turned on/off in Misc tab of the main UI 

- implemented bypass of all message filters for RX frequency of QSO, it can be turned on/off in 
  Misc tab of the main UI. Also bypass of RX frequency text filters is being triggered now if operator using 
  Decode button or double click on waterfall to decode again last interval or audio wav file

- main window popup functionality is implemented, it has no connection to 'beep' notification functionality now
  and user can control it via Misc tab

- 'beep'/system sound notification is being used once per decoded interval now. As there is possible to assign 
  melody in Windows OS to system sound multiple 'beep' sounds per interval caused audio chaos while overlapping 
  with each other.

- executable file name is changed from wsjtx.exe to jtdx.exe, jt9.exe process name is changed to jtdxjt9.exe.
  This change can let user to run JTDX and WSJT-X concurrently with no need in the rig-name key.
  JTAlert version 2.10.4 does support old and new JTDX executable names via user's selection in the settings.

- gray vertical marker line is implemented in plotter(waterfall) window to show top JT65 decoding frequency 
  set in Advanced tab ot the settings

- in JT9+JT65 combined mode gray horizontal line in plotter (waterfall) now will now show user if top JT65 
  decoding frequency is set by mistake or intentionally below the bottom JT9 decoding frequency, area where 
  software can not decode any signal is marked by the gray line

- transition from JT65 to JT9 and back to JT65 mode is simplified in JT9+JT65 combined mode if 'Lock Tx=Rx' 
  is not checked. Left and right mouse buttons (Rx and Tx frequency setting) and waterfall are being used 
  in this functionality.

  Let's say we are in JT65 band:  top JT65 decoding frequency from advanced tab of the Settings is being used 
  as threshold, if we setting on the waterfall Rx (or Tx) frequency above the top JT65 decoding frequency then 
  TX mode will be changed to JT9 and Tx (or Rx) frequency will be set equal to the chosen Rx (or Tx) frequency.

  There is JT65/JT9 frequency splitter from the watefall settings is being used as threshold for transition 
  from JT9 to JT65 mode, so we have gap where  transition will not be triggered. If in settings JT65/JT9 
  splitter is set to 2400 Hz and top JT65 decoding frequency set to 2700 Hz, there is 300Hz gap where this 
  functionality will not be working. 

- 'Auto TX' and 'Disable TX after 73' checkboxes moved from General tab of the settings to main window UI 
  as push buttons

- position of decoded messages windows vertical splitter is being stored now in JTDX.INI

- short message sequencing scenarios functionality is implemented and can be controlled via Sequencing tab 
  of the settings:

	- 'Halt Tx if operator I called answered to other operator' functionality, is active by default.
          This functionality will Halt Tx if decoded standard message is addressed to other operator and
	  has report or QTH locator inside.

	- 'Come back to calling CQ if there is no answer to report message decoded N times' functinality.
	  It can be used in calling CQ scenario and will trigger CQ message if counter has reached value N.

	- 'Halt TX if report message to me is not decoded after N transmissions' functionality. Can be used
	  replying to someone's CQ scenario, it will halt TX if transmissions counter has reached value N 
          and report message is not decoded.
  
	- 'Halt TX if the same report message was received N times' functionality. It is designed to stop
	  transmission if the same report message being received in the loop. It can be useful if other QSO
	  party operator can not decode a message addressed to him or left his software unattended.
 
	- 'Halt TX if the same RRR/RR73/73 message was received N times' functionality. It is designed to stop
	  transmission if the same RRR/RR73/73 message being received in the loop. It can be useful if other QSO
	  party operator can not decode a message addressed to him or left his software unattended.

- two defects fixed: AF frequency jump for T10 to JT9 mode transition and failure to set appropriate 
  band/VFO frequency for transition between WSPR and JT65/JT9+JT65 modes

- dual message (RRR+CQ or RR73+CQ) TX is implemented, right button of mouse can be used to control it by clicking 
  on RRR/RR73 button in QSO messages tab 2. Dual message TX is being toggled by right button of the mouse.
  This functionality can be used in JT65 mode if user received report better than -10dB SNR from other QSO party
  operator. Each message signal takes half of the transmission interval, getting approximately 50% error rate while being
  transmitted.

- optional automatic QSO logging functionality is implemented, it can be activated in Reporting tab of the settings 
  as alternative selection to 'Prompt me to log QSO'. Also it can be unchecked to get into manual QSO logging mode.

- DX Call window text will get green color background after QSO is logged, as a reminder at manual logging 
  and indicator of success for automatic QSO logging

- callsign checking is added for logging: in previous versions software did not prompt to log QSO at last TX  message 
  if two consecutive RRR/RR73/73 messages were transmitted with different QSO party callsign, now we getting either 
  prompt or automatic logging for this scenario

- default RX ceiling frequency for JT65 mode is changed from 3000Hz to 2700Hz

- optional 'show messages with my call in RX frequency window' functionality is implemented. It can be toggled 
  in Misc tab of the main window UI, by default it is turned on.

- improved detection of 'my call in decoded message' for notifications functionality

- 'Clear DX call and grid after logging' functionality is modified: in manual sequencing operation mode a timer 
  is implemented there to clean up DX Call and DX Grid windows at end of the interval where QSO is logged

- QSO time on / time off functionality is added while logging QSO, UDP data exchange is updated accordingly.
  QSO time on / time off recognition accuracy is improved.  

- processing of some wrong sequences of the standard messages is now being supported in manual and autosequencing 
  mode of operation:

	- scenario where 'CQ' message is answered by the 'ROGER+REPORT' message, it will
	  trigger 'ROGER+REPORT' message transmission
	- scenario where 'replying to CQ with grid' message is answered by the 'ROGER+REPORT' message, it will
	  trigger 'ROGER+REPORT' message transmission
	- scenario where 'REPORT' message is answered by 'REPORT' message, it will trigger 'RRR/RR73' message
	  transmission

- optional semi-autosequencing mode of operation is implemented to JT65/JT9/T10 modes. User have to choose by mouse 
  the decoded message for QSO in 'calling CQ' or 'replying to CQ' scenario, then autosequencing will automatically 
  generate required messages to continue and finish this QSO. In 'calling CQ' scenario autosequencing will continue 
  to call CQ after the QSO is finished, in 'replying to CQ' scenario it will disable TX after the QSO is finished.

  Autosequencing mode can be toggled with AutoSeq button in the main window UI.

  Autosequencing mode of operation can be used together with auto logging mode and short message sequencing scenarios
  functionality configured in the Sequencing tab of the settings with exception to the 'Halt TX if the same RRR/RR73/73 
  message was received N times' which is not supported in the autosequencing mode. 

  Standard type of messages is being processed by autosequencing on any frequency, while at end of QSO 
  reception/processing of some addressed free messages is supported if it does contain callsign and '73'. For instance 
  received messages like "UA1AAA TNX 73", "UA1AAA HNY73", "UA1AAA73MXMAS" can be processed by AutoSeq at end of QSO 
  and responded with '73' standard message.

  Also autosequencing can process unaddressed free message at end of QSO if it is received on the RX frequency of QSO 
  and containing '73' inside. For instance message like '15W 3EL TU73' can be processed and responded with '73' 
  standard message.

- latest version of Hamlib 3.2 was used to build JTDX v18.0.0.133 installation package for MS Windows OS

Upgrade from  JTDX v17.x versions to JTDX v18.0 and backwards: 
JTDX.INI file has different structure, it is recommended to delete old JTDX.INI
Also it is recommended to use latest version of the CALL3.TXT file, this file is supplied with
the software package. 

Detailed instructions on how to delete JTDX.INI file are published there: 
http://www.qrz.lt/ly3bg/JTDX/info/instal.html#notes

Changing mode name for previously logged JT10 QSOs: in wsjtx_log.adi file using any text editor 
replace  <mode:4>JT10   with   <mode:3>T10 
PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CREATED BACKUP COPY OF YOUR LOG FILE BEFORE MAKING CHANGES THERE.

Compatibility of JTDX v18.0.0.133 with JTAlert software:

JTDX v18.0.0.133 is being supported by JTAlert v2.10.4.
Please select in the JTAlert settings 'jtdx.exe' as process name to let it work with JTDX.
Since default setting is 'wsjtx.exe' JTAlert can not start with JTDX sofware at first time, 
WSJT-X + JTAlert software pair can be used to get to JTAlert settings.

Recommended settings:

- AGCc button: use it only if AGC being triggered in receiver by JT signals at beginning of the RX interval.
  Noise level change in the waterfall might be used as criterion showing that AGC is triggered in the receiver. 
- Hint button: use it to decode signals on the QSO frequency and for wideband hinted decoding of the CQ messages
- Clean DX, use it to clean DX Call DX Grid windows if data there is not required, this way user
  could avoid some false hinted decodes  

Advanced settings tab:

- Number of decoding attempts: set it as per required decoding time. It might be set to 1 if CPU frequency is 2GHz,
  and set to 3 if CPU frequency is equal to 3GHz. Higher values make better decoding performance.

- Number of decoding passes = 4 (may be set to 3 or 2 for CPU frequency less than 2GHz if decoding attempts=1 is 
  not enough to get into 10 second decoding time). For VHF usage optimal number of decoding passes = 2, and number
  of decoding attempts may be increased to improve decoding efficiency.

- RX frequency decoding attempts: set it to 1 for slow CPU, 2 for fast CPU. Value 3 may be used for 8+ core CPUs.

- Harmonics decoding depth. Set it to 0 if you would like to turn off this functionality. Value 3 can be used for
  most CPUs and provides good efficiency for decoding of the harmonics, value 4 can be used with fast CPUs.

- Hinted decoding DT range = 1

- use frequency mask decoding: frequency mask being derived from the first decoding pass.
  Frequency mask decoding is enabled in the code by default, depending on number of the signals on the band 
  software making decision to turn it OFF (software does recognize band conditions and frequency mask decoding 
  can be automatically turned off if there are too many signals on the band). New setting in the Advanced tab 
  does prohibit turning frequency mask decoding passes OFF, it makes some benefit for overloaded band scenario 
  and shall be used if user has fast CPU.

T10 mode settings:

Set number of decoding attempts to 1, this value can be increased if CPU is fast enough to finish decoding
until expiration of the decoding timer. Too high number of decoding attempts can cause degradation of the decoding 
efficiency if list of candidates being cut off by decoding timer.



Frequency range on the waterfall: set waterfall window size to the frequency range you wish to be decoded.
Bins/Pixel settings would let user to choose suitable waterfall window size. Any signal located outside of the 
watefall graph WILL NOT be decoded.

  To get proper hinted decoding and FTSRD false decodes filtering operation CALL3.TXT file shall be 
copied to the JTDX log directory (from JTDX software do  File -> Open log directory). 

  JTDX software is making some false FTRSD and hinted decodes. Any hinted decode marked by asterisk 
and FTRSD decodes marked by questionmark, being blocked for sending to the pskreporter.info server, 
but can be reported by JTAlert software to the hamspots.net server.  

Warning: high number of decoding attempts setting and SWL mode take high CPU utilisation for prolonged time, 
causing greater power consumption and increased power dissipation/CPU cooling requirements.
